          <p>
            😼 An engineer of both software and machines, with an addiction to
            learning and deep work, and particular interest in leveraging
            introspection, agile and serverless systems. Through injecting more
            programming into his non-cs university degree, time was freed up for
            other commitments, leading to practical experience in
            entrepreneurship and product prototyping. Possesses a track record
            of successful engineering and research projects acquired by
            leveraging team members and picking up new skills, whether through
            deep work, rapid bootstrapping or making mistakes, but more
            importantly an open-mind and supportive mentors and supervisors.

            ♻🐄 🐟🐔🎣 You got this far... here's a shameless plug for the
            environment: by 2050 there'll be more plastic than fish in the
            ocean. (by weight). There's work to be done!

            🧠 Measure your open-mindedness by how recently you reversed a
            strongly held belief/ opinion after an interaction with a more
            believable person. A believable person, according to Ray Dalio, is
            one with a track record in the area.
